### POMODORO CLOCK

This project is part of [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) javascript curriculum.

It focused on practicing javascript functions. To do it, I incorporated sound cues and toggling, progress bar updating in real time, adjustable work/rest times, and background color gradually changing throughout each work/rest cycle.
